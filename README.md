##### Master of Pharmacy Research - Drug Repurposing using Machine Learning and Neural Networks

# Abstract
## Purpose
This study aims to compare performances of machine learning models using different representations of drug-protein interactions, including binary representation, quantitative representation, and biological network. Predictions of drug therapeutic classes from machine learning methods are used to identify drug repurposing opportunities.

## Methods
Drug-protein information was extracted from BindingDB. Median binding affinity values were used. Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification codes were included as drug therapeutic classes. Quantitative matrix was
obtained by data normalisation. Binary matrix was obtained by classifying binding affinity values into having interaction (1) or not (0), using threshold cut-off value. Biological networks were constructed and topological data analysis was performed. Four new matrices were used in machine learning methods to build artificial neural networks. Performances of machine learning models were compared. Predictions of therapeutic classes were manually evaluated. Incorrectly predicted therapeutic classes were treated as possible repurposing opportunities.

## Results
Biological networks resulted in the best performance in machine learning methods, followed by quantitative representation and lastly binary classification. Phentolamine, a cardiovascular agent, was found to be useful as a nervous system agent.
